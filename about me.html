				<br>
				<p>I’m 19 years old my birthday was on April 19,2001 and I’m from
				Pasig City. Currently taking BS IT at Pamantasan ng lungsod ng Pasig,
				My favorite color is black and I really love listening to music.
				My favorite comfort food is turon, one thing I know I do well is cooking I am
				easy to learn at cooking. I look up to my mother because she was the strongest
				woman I've ever know, she was a single mom that's why I also admire her.
				An accomplishment I'm proud of is graduating as an honor student when I was
				at senior high. If I were to volunteer, it would be for charity honestly that is
				one of my dream.
